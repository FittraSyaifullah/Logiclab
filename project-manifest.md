# Project Manifest: LogicLab (Overhaul)

## Project Overview
LogicLab is an AI-powered product creation platform that allows non-technical users to build hardware or software prototypes, run business analysis, and generate 3D visualizations or working demo apps without coding. The platform integrates multiple APIs including adamcad for 3D modeling, Perplexity/SONAR for business analysis, v0 for software generation, Stripe for payments, and Supabase for authentication and data persistence.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.3 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and data persistence
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state management
- **Authentication**: Custom session management with localStorage persistence
- **API Integration**: v0 API for software generation, Supabase for user management
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components following DRY principles

## Current Status
- Last updated: January 2025
- Current milestone: Dashboard UI implementation and authentication flow completion
- Current stage: 85% complete

## Components
- **Authentication System**: ✅ Complete - Login/signup flows, session management, protected routes
- **Dashboard Layout**: ✅ Complete - Main dashboard with header, sidebar, and content areas
- **Initial Prompt Form**: ✅ Complete - Integrated form for project creation with hardware/software toggle
- **Navigation & Sidebar**: ✅ Complete - App sidebar, chat sidebar, logo hover sidebar
- **Content Viewer Components**: ✅ Complete - Viewer panel, software viewer, code viewer
- **Modal/Overlay Components**: ✅ Complete - Integration panel, growth marketing panel, debug panel
- **UI Primitives**: ✅ Complete - All required shadcn/ui components (button, input, textarea, etc.)
- **State Management**: ✅ Complete - User store, creation store with proper TypeScript types
- **API Routes**: ✅ Complete - Authentication endpoints, v0 integration
- **Database Schema**: ✅ Complete - User management with display_name triggers

## Next Steps
- **Hardware Specification Modal**: Implement hardware spec modal for detailed hardware project configuration
- **Image Optimization**: Convert key `<img>` usages to `next/image` for better performance
- **Chat Integration**: Implement chat functionality for project refinement
- **3D Model Generation**: Complete PartCrafter API integration for hardware projects
- **Business Analysis**: Implement Perplexity/SONAR integration for market analysis
- **Payment Integration**: Add Stripe integration for subscription management

## Testing Notes
- **Authentication Flow**: Login/signup works correctly, sessions persist across page refreshes
- **Dashboard Access**: Protected routes properly redirect unauthenticated users
- **Form Integration**: Initial prompt form is properly integrated into dashboard layout
- **Known Issues**: 
  - Some Next.js dev tools errors (non-blocking)
  - Missing image files in public/images (user needs to upload actual images)
  - Database schema warnings for missing first_name/last_name columns (handled gracefully)

## Configuration
- **Environment Setup**: 
  - Supabase URL and Anon Key configured
  - v0 API Key configured
  - Next.js running on port 3001 (3000 in use)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Core: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
  - UI: shadcn/ui, Radix UI primitives
  - State: Zustand
  - 3D: @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three
  - PDF: jspdf
  - Database: Supabase client

## Development Notes
- **Core Principles**: Strict adherence to DRY, KISS, Clean File System, and Transparent Error Handling
- **Code Quality**: All TypeScript errors resolved, ESLint warnings minimized
- **Responsive Design**: UI components are responsive across multiple breakpoints
- **Session Management**: Custom implementation using localStorage with expiration checking
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

The project is in a solid state with core functionality working and ready for the next phase of development focusing on advanced features and integrations.
